# Kernel-Density-Estimation

Done as part of the course SMAI/Monsoon23

Implemented Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). It includes the following functions

• allows selection from the following kernels: box, gaussian, triangular
• fit data
• select appropriate bandwidth using the pseudo-likelihood method
• evaluate the density given an input x
• visualize the data and the estimated pdf. For this, assumed that the function will be used only when input dataset is 1-D or 2-D.
